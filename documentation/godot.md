   - Define visual assets, animations, and collision shapes.

2. **Implement AI Behavior:**
   - Attach scripts to handle enemy behavior, including movement, attacks, and patrols.
   - Use state machines to manage different enemy states (idle, chasing, attacking).

### NPC Interactions
1. **Create NPC Scenes:**
   - Add scenes for non-combat NPCs (shopkeepers, hunters, jewelers, etc.).
   - Define visual assets and animations.

2. **Implement Dialogue and Quests:**
   - Use the `Dialogic` plugin or a custom dialogue system for NPC interactions.
   - Script quests and rewards for completing tasks given by NPCs.

## Procedural Generation

### Generating Levels
1. **Create Generation Script:**
   - Write a script to handle the procedural generation of levels using predefined rules.
   - Use the `RandomNumberGenerator` class for randomization.

2. **Define Generation Parameters:**
   - Set parameters for the size, complexity, and content of each level.
   - Use noise functions (e.g., Perlin noise) to generate natural-looking terrain.

### Using Seeds
1. **Implement Seed Input:**
   - Add a text input field for players to enter seeds.
   - Validate the seed input and use it to initialize the RNG.

2. **Generate Consistent Worlds:**
   - Use the seed to ensure the same world is generated each time.
   - Allow for special seeds that trigger unique world configurations or easter eggs.

## Combat System

### Weapon Mechanics
1. **Create Weapons:**
   - Design weapons such as swords, pickaxes, and crossbows.
   - Add visual assets and define their properties (damage, range, etc.).

2. **Implement Weapon Use:**
   - Script the behavior for using weapons, including animations and hit detection.
   - Use signals to handle weapon impacts on enemies and the environment.

### Combat Interactions
1. **Define Combat Mechanics:**
   - Implement health and damage systems for the player and enemies.
   - Use state machines to manage combat states (attacking, defending, taking damage).

2. **Enhance Combat with Effects:**
   - Add particle effects and sound effects for combat actions.
   - Use screen shake and other visual effects to enhance the impact of combat.

## Resource Gathering and Crafting
