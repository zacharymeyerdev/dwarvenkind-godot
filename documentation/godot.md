   func _process(delta):
       handle_input()
       move_and_slide(velocity)
   ```

3. **Handle Input:**
   - Use the `Input` class to detect player input and update the character's velocity accordingly.
   ```gd
   func handle_input():
       velocity = Vector2()
       if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_right"):
           velocity.x += speed
       if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_left"):
           velocity.x -= speed
       if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_down"):
           velocity.y += speed
       if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_up"):
           velocity.y -= speed
       velocity = velocity.normalized() * speed
   ```

4. **Animate Movement:**
   - Update the `AnimatedSprite` based on the player's movement direction.
   ```gd
   func _process(delta):
       handle_input()
